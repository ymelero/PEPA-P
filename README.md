  This repository hosts the code and resources for my project proposal, <b>PEPA</b>:   
  <i>Integrating <b>P</b>opulation <b>E</b>cology and <b>P</b>henotypic <b>A</b>daptation under Environmental Change.</i>   
  Currently, it includes the scripts used to generate the figures included in the proposal.   
  If the project secures funding (fingers crossed!), additional content and developments will follow.

  Its true inspiration, however, comes from something far more meaningful:

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first Spanish Constitution from 1812. Known as <i>La Pepa</i>, it was a groundbreaking milestone in Spanish history, 
  laying the foundation for constitutionalism. It introduced progressive principles for its time, such as national sovereignty, 
  the separation of powers, and equality before the law. The Constitution also guaranteed fundamental rights like freedom of the press 
  and abolished feudal privileges, serving as a symbol of progress and inspiring.
  </p>
  Still, while our contribution may not shape societies like a Constitution, we hope it serves as a small but meaningful step 
  toward preserving the ecological richness that is us all.
