  This repository hosts the code and resources for my project <b>PEPA</b>:   
  <i>Integrating <b>P</b>opulation <b>E</b>cology and <b>P</b>henotypic <b>A</b>daptation under Environmental Change.</i>   
  Currently, it includes the scripts used to generate the figures included in the proposal.   
  The project will start in February 2026, additional content and developments will follow. It has been funded by the Spanish National Research Agency PID2024-156160NB-100

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first Spanish Constitution from 1812. Known as <i>La Pepa</i>, it was a groundbreaking milestone in Spanish history, 
  laying the foundation for constitutionalism. It introduced progressive principles for its time, such as national sovereignty, 
  the separation of powers, and equality in the eyes of the law. The Constitution also guaranteed fundamental rights like freedom of the press 
  and abolished feudal privileges, serving as a symbol of progress and inspiring.
  </p>
  Still, while our contribution may not shape societies like a Constitution, we hope it serves as a small but meaningful step 
  toward preserving the ecological richness that is us all.
